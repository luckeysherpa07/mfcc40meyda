      <p>
        As we're using <span class="code">requestAnimationFrame</span>, if the
        window becomes obscured or hidden the rAF loop will pause until the
        window is in view again. In that time BeatDetektor will no longer have
        frames of audio sent to it and the BPM will become 0.
